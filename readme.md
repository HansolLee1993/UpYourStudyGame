## Up Your Study Game

Inspired by JackboxTV gaming style and BCIT's cohort program, we want to incorporate fun and a sense of community into education. 

- Create rooms for your team.
- Answer questions in pairs and the team votes on the best response.
- Point system determines a winner.
- Customize question sets to target your learning strategy.

Learning is a lot easier when you can share the knowledge of your peers -- and this format of delivery absolutely encourages discussion and getting to know your team.
